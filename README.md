Good News Everyone!
I've decided to teach myself (using online resources of course) how to code/program/etc over the course of this coming year.
I will be eligible for educational support from my job approximately at the start of 2021, at which time, I will further expand upon my knowledge & from there seek employment within the field.
Possibly from my same employer, albiet in a different branch of it.
This will be one of my primary resources of the year to come.
